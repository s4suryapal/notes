## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Structure (AsyncStorage)
```
Keys:
- notes:list          → ["uuid1", "uuid2", ...]
- note:{uuid}         → Note object
- categories:list     → [Category objects]
- settings           → App preferences
- trash:list         → Deleted note IDs with deletion date
```

### State Management
- Context API + useReducer for global state
- Local state for UI-only concerns
- Custom hooks for data operations

### Auto-Save Strategy
- 300ms debounce on text input
- Background save queue
- Optimistic UI updates
- Save indicator in UI

3. **Data Safety:** Auto-save, undo, soft delete
4. **Simple & Clean:** Samsung Notes-like simplicity
5. **Delightful:** Smooth animations, haptics, polish
